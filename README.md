This is my own private SuperCollider code folder.

It's just a folder (mostly for tests and play), so don't expect the best programming skills or masterworks.

It's also a showcase for beginners that might find my noobish code useful.

It includes:

* synths I use frequently (and can be loaded independently)
* stuff that I'm working on, some usable, some still in development (or only ideas for the future)
* livecoding history (just sessions if I forget to start the History in the middle of a Jam)
* some projects, applications and tools I made in the past or I'm still working on

some code was made by me and other snips are retrieved from the web (on those cases i normally include the credits/links about the author).

Feel free to contact me, send me your comments, problems with my code and/or corrections/improvements.

You can learn more about supercollider on github project web site:
